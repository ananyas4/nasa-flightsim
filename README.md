#  NASA EPFD Gamified Flight Sim VR Experience  
 **Developed for NASAâ€™s Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) Project**  
ðŸŽ® **Unity | VR | Gamified Public Outreach**

This project is a **VR-based, gamified flight training experience** designed to educate the public about NASAâ€™s **Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD)** initiative. It was showcased as part of NASAâ€™s **public outreach efforts** to engage and inform audiences about the future of sustainable aviation.

##  My Contributions
- **Developed the core VR experience** using **Unity** and **OpenXR**.
- **Designed a gamified flight tutorial using Logitech Flight Simulator Yoke System** to simulate electric aircraft propulsion concepts.
- **Implemented real-time aircraft performance visualizations** to educate users interactively.

##  How It Works
- Users take control of a **virtual hybrid-electric aircraft** in a simulated flight environment.
- An **AI-powered tutorial** guides them through key EPFD technologies, such as **electric propulsion systems**.
- Players interact with the **cockpit controls** to experience how hybrid-electric aircraft operate.
- The simulation provides **real-time feedback** and **educational prompts** to enhance understanding.
